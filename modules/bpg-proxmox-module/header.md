# bpg-proxmox-module

This repository contains Terraform modules, based on [bpg/proxmox](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/bpg/proxmox/latest/docs), for provisioning virtual machines on Proxmox using Cloud-Init for configuration management. The modules provide reusable and configurable components that can be used to define and deploy virtual machines in a Proxmox environment.
